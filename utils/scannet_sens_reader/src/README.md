### Scannet Sens Reader

ScanNet has a special type of compression called .sens.
These .sens files store all sensor data (RGB/depth/IMU/camera calibration/distortion calibration)
    throughout the scene capture.

This toolkit is provided by the ScanNet official which processes these data in-place in C++.
